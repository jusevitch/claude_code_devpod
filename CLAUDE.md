# CLAUDE.md File

Fill this file out with context for your project. You can do this manually, or by deleting this file and running `/init` from the Claude Code CLI. Make sure to have some actual code present before running `/init`.

Tips from the [official documentation:](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)

> CLAUDE.md is a special file that Claude automatically pulls into context when starting a conversation. This makes it an ideal place for documenting:
> 
> * Common bash commands
> * Core files and utility functions
> * Code style guidelines
> * Testing instructions
> * Repository etiquette (e.g., branch naming, merge vs. rebase, etc.)
> * Developer environment setup (e.g., pyenv use, which compilers work)
> * Any unexpected behaviors or warnings particular to the project
> * Other information you want Claude to remember
> 
> Thereâ€™s no required format for CLAUDE.md files. We recommend keeping them concise and human-readable.
